# Momentum T-Embed — Flipper Zero ESP32 Port

A port of the [Flipper Zero](https://flipperzero.one/) firmware — with the **Momentum** feature set — to the **LilyGo T-Embed CC1101** and other ESP32 boards. It brings the Flipper Zero UI, services, and application framework to affordable ESP32 hardware — no Flipper Zero required.

## Remote access: firmware and gateway

This repository contains the **device firmware**. Its Web Filesystem service
also exposes the versioned RPC API documented in
[`docs/webfs-rpc.md`](docs/webfs-rpc.md): device status, capabilities,
diagnostics, SD-card access, and receive-only Sub-GHz jobs.

The companion
[`RPC-Gateway_for_momentum-t-embed-cc1101-rpc`](https://github.com/crimson1968/RPC-Gateway_for_momentum-t-embed-cc1101-rpc)
repository contains the **Docker gateway**. It translates the device API into
MCP tools, provides a browser interface, and optionally uses USB for screen and
button control. It is deployed on a trusted LAN; no OpenAI API key is needed.

```text
MCP client / browser
        |
        v
Docker RPC Gateway  -- USB serial -->  T-Embed screen and buttons
        |
        +-- private-LAN HTTP ------->  Web Filesystem RPC in this firmware
```

Start **Web Filesystem** on the T-Embed for Wi-Fi RPC functions. The gateway
does not replace this firmware and does not add RF transmission or an arbitrary
command endpoint; its Sub-GHz API remains receive-only.

For setup, normal startup, qFlipper/WebFS operation, SD-card access, and
troubleshooting, see the **[English user guide](docs/USER_GUIDE.md)**.

## ✨ New in v2 — written for this fork

Added for the LilyGo T-Embed by [ElicoftZ](https://github.com/ElicoftZ). These are original
to this fork — present in neither the Sor3nt port nor Momentum. Per-feature provenance is
verified in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

- **Dual Boot** — install and switch between multiple firmwares from a boot menu, with a hardware side-button recovery escape hatch. Dynamic multi-boot partition layout with interrupted-update recovery.
- **Power Profiler** — live power-draw trace from the BQ27220 fuel gauge.
- **Wardriving** — passive WiFi + BLE + Sub-GHz logger to PSRAM, built on the port's WiFi stack.
- **BLE Detector** — rapid Bluetooth device scanning & profiling, with unbounded scan lists.
- **Macro Pad** — USB/BLE HID macro recorder & playback.
- **Mic & audio tools** — microphone level, sonar, waterfall and logger, tone generator, ultrasonic, voice notes.
- **Hotspot Arcade** — ESP-IDF integration of [tarikbc](https://github.com/tarikbc/hotspot-arcade)'s arcade (the game itself is © tarikbc, MIT).
- **Settings backup**, plus the under-the-hood NimBLE integration the wireless apps depend on.

## 🔀 Inherited from the Sor3nt ESP32 port

These come from [Sor3nt/Flipper-Zero-ESP32-Port](https://github.com/Sor3nt/Flipper-Zero-ESP32-Port),
the port this repository is forked from — **not written here**:

- **WiFi suite** — Evil Portal, AirSnitch, Probe Sniffer, Smart Deauth, SMB Browser, Web-Filesystem, Android TV Remote.
- **OTA firmware updates** — *Settings → Update Firmware*, over WiFi, with SD-card sync.
- **Streaming** — unified music & video (AirPlay, Chromecast, DLNA).
- **U2F / FIDO2 (CTAP2)** security key, dolphin passport, and the Interface / Spoofing settings.
- **ESP-NOW** and **NRF24** tooling.
- **Community apps** — NFC Magic, MIFARE Fuzzer, NFC/RFID Detector, RFID2 Reader, Reverse Shell, Roulette, WMBuster, TagTinker — plus the full base Flipper app set (NFC, SubGHz, Infrared, BadUSB, …).

The **Momentum** feature set that came in through the merge — the Momentum settings app,
Control Centre, dolphin levels, passport and menu styles — originates with
[Momentum Firmware](https://github.com/Next-Flip/Momentum-Firmware).

> Exact per-directory breakdown (**19 written here · 3 from Momentum · 175 from the port**,
> across 197 directories) is in [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

## Supported Boards

| Board | MCU | Display | Input | SubGHz | NFC | IR | SD Card |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LilyGo T-Embed CC1101** | ESP32-S3 (Xtensa LX7) | ST7789 320×170 | Rotary encoder + button | CC1101 | PN532 (I2C) | RMT TX + RX | SPI |
| **Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.9** | ESP32-C6 (RISC-V) | ST7789V2 320×172 | CST816S touch | — | — | — | SPI |
| **Waveshare ESP32-C6-LCD-1.47** ⚠️ | ESP32-C6 (RISC-V) | JD9853 320×172 | AXS5106L touch | — | — | — | SPI |
| **DIY ESP32-S3 with 2.8" TFT** ⚠️ | ESP32-S3 (Xtensa LX7) | 2.8" ILI9341 320×240 | 6× Tactile buttons | CC1101 | PN532 (I2C) | TX | SPI |

> ⚠️ **Waveshare ESP32-C6 boards — limited.** The ESP32-C6 has only **512 KB SRAM and no PSRAM**, so RAM-heavy apps are effectively non-functional. In particular WiFi monitor mode / handshake capture fails (`esf_buf_setup_static: alloc eb fail` → `ESP_ERR_NO_MEM`). Treat these boards as usable only for lightweight apps. The full feature set targets the PSRAM-equipped **T-Embed**.

## How to Flash

The easiest way is the **web flasher** — no toolchain required, just a Chrome/Edge browser and a USB cable:

**[▶ Flash via Browser](https://elicoftz.github.io/Momuntum_Flipper_For_T_Embed/interface.html)**

Connect your board, click flash, done. After flashing, copy the contents of **[sdcard.zip](https://github.com/ElicoftZ/Momuntum_Flipper_For_T_Embed/releases/latest/download/sdcard.zip)** onto a FAT32 SD card and insert it — most apps need files there to function.

## Firmware Update

The T-Embed can update itself — no PC toolchain or re-flashing required:

- **Over WiFi (OTA):** *Settings → Update Firmware* checks the release server for a newer build, downloads and installs it in the background, then reboots. It also keeps your SD card files in sync.
- **Dual Boot:** install and switch between multiple firmware images from the boot menu; hold the side/Back button at power-on for ~3 s for a hardware recovery back to this firmware.

> OTA requires the dual-OTA partition layout. A device on the old single-app layout has to be flashed once via the web flasher before wireless OTA updates work.

## Apps

### 📡 Wireless / RF

A complete starter kit is in [sdcard.zip](https://github.com/ElicoftZ/Momuntum_Flipper_For_T_Embed/releases/latest/download/sdcard.zip) — extract it onto a FAT32 SD.

## Building

Requires **[ESP-IDF v5.4.1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.4.1/esp32s3/get-started/)** (exact version).

### Linux / macOS
```bash
./buildAndFlash_T-Embed.sh            # T-Embed (build + flash)
./buildAndFlash_T-Embed.sh --build-only
```

### Windows
```bat
:: source ESP-IDF v5.4.1 first (C:\Espressif\frameworks\esp-idf-v5.4.1\export.bat)
idf.py -B build_multiboot -DFLIPPER_BOARD=lilygo_t_embed_cc1101 -DSDKCONFIG=build_multiboot/sdkconfig build
```
The dual-boot shipping image is built in `build_multiboot/`. Flash the app at offset `0x20000`.

### Build a FAP
```bash
./buildFap.sh applications/main/my_app   # firmware must be built first
```

## Porting Approach

Preserves the original Flipper Zero architecture as closely as possible:
- **Furi OS** on FreeRTOS with the same thread/mutex/event/record API
- **HAL** maps STM32 peripherals to ESP-IDF (SPI → `esp_lcd`, I2C → PN532/CST816S, RMT → IR, NimBLE → BLE, TinyUSB → USB-HID)
- **Display** renders the original 128×64 mono framebuffer, then 2× upscales to RGB565
- **Crypto** uses real mbedtls (no Flipper-Enclave key — affects encrypted SubGHz keystores only)
